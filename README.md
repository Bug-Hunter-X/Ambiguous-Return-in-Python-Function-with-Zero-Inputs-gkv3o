This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python. The file "bug.py" contains a function with ambiguous return behavior when both inputs are zero.  The solution in "bugSolution.py" addresses this issue by explicitly handling the case where both inputs are zero, preventing unexpected behavior or potential errors. This scenario highlights a subtle issue that can be easily overlooked and might cause unexpected behavior in real-world applications. The solution emphasizes clear error handling and improved code robustness.
